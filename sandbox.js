// Reminder: creating a function does not execute the function or its enclosed logic
    // you much call the function if you want it to do its job.

// Reminder: invoking a function does not automatically retain what it returns in a variable
    // meaning the above invocations to trigger the logic to execute, as well as return the expected string
    // but that string is not logged to the console or assigned to a global variable that can be used later
        // alter the 3 lines calling the function to:
            // save one returned string to a variable
            // log one to the console
            // save one returned string to a variable and then log that variable to the console.
